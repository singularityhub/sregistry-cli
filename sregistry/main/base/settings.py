    '''Look for a setting in the environment (first priority) and then
       the settings file (second). If something is found, the settings
       file is updated. The order of operations works as follows:

       1. The .sregistry settings file is used as a cache for the variable
       2. the environment variable always takes priority to cache, and if
          found, will update the cache.
       3. If the variable is not found and the cache is set, we are good
       5. If the variable is not found and the cache isn't set, return
          default (default is None)

       So the user of the function can assume a return of None equates to
       not set anywhere, and take the appropriate action.
