       the branch, job name, artifact folder, and tag of the container.
       The minimum that we need are the job id, collection, and job name. Eg:

       job_id|collection|job_name   (or)

       Parameters
       ==========
       images: refers to the uri given by the user to pull in the format
               specified above
       file_name: the user's requested name for the file. It can 
                  optionally be None if the user wants a default.
       save: if True, you should save the container to the database
