       6881ae2e-db26-11e5-9772-22000b9da45e:.singularity/shub/sherlock_vep.simg

    Parameters
    ==========
    images: refers to the globus endpoint id and image path.
    file_name: the user's requested name for the file. It can 
               optionally be None if the user wants a default.
    save: if True, you should save the container to the database
          using self.add(). For globus this is the only option, and
          we don't have control over when this happens.
