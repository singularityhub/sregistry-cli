def pull(self, images, file_name=None, save=True, **kwargs):
    '''pull an image from a Globus endpoint. The user must have the default
       local endpoint set up. For example:

       6881ae2e-db26-11e5-9772-22000b9da45e:.singularity/shub/sherlock_vep.simg

    Parameters
    ==========
    images: refers to the globus endpoint id and image path.
    file_name: the user's requested name for the file. It can 
               optionally be None if the user wants a default.
    save: if True, you should save the container to the database
          using self.add(). For globus this is the only option, and
          we don't have control over when this happens.
    
    Returns
    =======
    finished: a single container path, or list of paths
