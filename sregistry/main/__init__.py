'''

This is a base client that imports functions depending on the API it is 
    using. Currently, it supports singularity hub and registry, with default
    to use Singularity Hub.

       get the correct client depending on the driver of interest. The
       selected client can be chosen based on the environment variable
       SREGISTRY_CLIENT, and later changed based on the image uri parsed
       If there is no preference, the default is to load the singularity 
       hub client.

       Parameters
       ==========
       image: if provided, we derive the correct client based on the uri
       of an image. If not provided, we default to environment, then hub.
       quiet: if True, suppress most output about the client (e.g. speak)
