# Singularity Global Clients
Singularity Registry Global client has tutorials and walkthroughs for the following clients:

 - [Singularity Hub](/sregistry-cli/client-hub): the default endpoint will work (search and pull) images from Singularity Hub.
 - [Singularity Registry](/sregistry-cli/client-registry): to interact with an institution or personally hosted Singularity Registry.

## Builders
For a subset of the clients above, we have developed remote builders, meaning that
you can issue a command locally to use your remote credential to deploy a remote builder.
We provide details for builders here.

 - [Google Compute](/sregistry-cli/client-google-compute): Build an image on Google Compute and upload to Google Storage.
