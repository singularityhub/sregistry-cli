# Singularity Global Clients
Singularity Registry Global client has tutorials and walkthroughs for the following clients:

 - [Global Commands](/sregistry-cli/commands): commands for all clients.
 - [Docker Hub](/sregistry-cli/client-docker): interact with layers to build images from Docker Hub
 - [Dropbox](/sregistry-cli/client-dropbox): interact with images stored in Dropbox
 - [Google Container Registry](/sregistry-cli/client-gcr): the same as docker. Here are tricks for authenticating if you have trouble.
 - [Google Storage](/sregistry-cli/client-google-storage): interact with images from Google Storage
 - [Google Drive](/sregistry-cli/client-google-drive): interact with images from Google Drive
 - [Nvidia Container Registry](/sregistry-cli/client-nvidia): Nvidia Container registry serves Docker images
 - [Singularity Hub](/sregistry-cli/client-hub): the default endpoint will work (search and pull) images from Singularity Hub.
 - [Singularity Registry](/sregistry-cli/client-registry): to interact with an institution or personally hosted Singularity Registry.

## Builders
For a subset of the clients above, we have developed remote builders, meaning that
you can issue a command locally to use your remote credential to deploy a remote builder.
We provide details for builders here.

 - [Google Compute](/sregistry-cli/client-google-compute): Build an image on Google Compute and upload to Google Storage.
